                    <p class="section-paragraph">My experience in the Software Engineering program at Iowa State
					has been a great one.  I have learned a lot both in a classroom sense as well as about myself.<br><br>
					As far as coursework, ISU has certianly prepared me to become an engineeer. Courses such as S E 309,
					S E 329, S E 339 taught me how to go about designing a system and program it myself.  Some of the complicated
					programming courses taught me how to solve difficult engineering problems; courses like COM S 430, CPR E
					419, and COM S 311 were great for this.<br><br>
					Some of the difficult coursework certainly caused me to look beyond what I learned in class to solve the problems
					presented.  There were many different resources that I took advantage of to solve these problems.  One of these
					was using my peers for advice.  My peers all have different experiences than myself, so we could help one another 
					with problems we were having.  Beyond this, the internet was a great resource.  All sorts of difficult programmming
					concepts have great explanations online that I could rely on if I was stuck. <br><br>
					Beyond the technical aspects, I have learned a lot about group work and working for the community.
					Classes that emphasized group work, such as S E 309, taught me about being on a team.  Beyond that,
					being a part of a team at work, at both of my teaching assistant positions as well as my community advisor
					position, taught me a lot about being a cohesive unit with your coworkers.  The community advisor position
					has also opened my eyes to a lot of ethical issues in the world, and has helped me be more attentive of those.<br><br>
					
					One of my big takeaways from school is my desire to keep learning.  Outside of my coursework, I kept learning.
					I spent a lot of time learning about mobile application development, both in the Mobile Development Club and on
					my own.  I am now serving as the club's Android Officer.<br><br>
					I also learned a lot through my teaching assistant positions.  I was forced to learn how to think about problems
					in many different ways, as others understand problems in different manners to myself.  To best help them, I had to
					be able to think from their perspective.
					<br><br>
					If I were to do my undergraduate work again, I would probably try to get more involved in the Computer Science department
					earlier on.  I've worked in three different positions for them during my time at Iowa State, but I wish I had been doing it
					for longer, especially serving as a teaching assistant.  My time as a teaching assistant helped me find my love of teaching
					others, and I wish I had been able to do it for longer.
