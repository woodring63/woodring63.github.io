                    <p class="section-paragraph"> The general education courses I have taken at Iowa
					State have helped shape me as a programmer. I think the most beneficial course I took was Introduction to Philosophy.
					Philosophy really is the foundation upon which programming is built, so being able to look
					at real world situations through the lens of a "programmer", or philosopher in this case, was
					very helpful in helping me approach engineering problems, as, in a way, I had to think about real world situations
					as programming and engineering problems.  Since this is not the typical use for my programming knowledge,
					it forced me to think about things in a much different way, which helped build that problem solving foundation.
					
					<br><br>Futhermore, my general education courses have helped me grow as a person.  I think
					the best example of such a course was Human Sexuality.  Though this may not be obvious at first,
					this class helped me see the different ways in which people think and values that they hold.  This
					Helped me grow as a human being, which is very important in the workplace.  By being able to see
					these different points of view better, I am more able to see potential other solutions or approaches
					to solving a problem.  I also feel that I am better equipped to interact with those of a different background
					as myself, which is extremely likely to be the case in my career at some point, if not at my first job.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    I feel like as a whole, my time at Iowa State has allowed me to apply my engineering skills to a broader context.  One of my in class projects was an application desgined to help students meet up with other students in order to form study groups.  This concept could potentially have a large societal impact.  An application like this facilitates learning and development, which is great for preparing others to enter society. The fact that I have been able to create something with this much potential impact while in school is awesome, and it's all thanks to the courses I have taken.
					
					<br><br>
					My short term goal is to work in the industry at a job that is both intellectually stimulating, as well
					as being relatively relaxed.  One of the most important things to me is work life balance, so it is very
					important that I don't have a job which demands crazy hours, but I do wish to work in an environment where
					I am challenged by my work.
					<br><br>
					In the long term, I would like to come back to school to eventually get my PhD.  I know that I want to teach
					someday, as I have developed a passion for it through my work as a TA, and this would allow me to do so.
