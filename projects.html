            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This application was designed to help the user find other students in courses they were enrolled in
            to study with.  The user is prompted to login with a Google Account, which all Iowa State students have.  They open
            to a Google Map, where they can see all study sessions occuring in the next 2 weeks for courses they are enrolled in
            when creating the account.  From there, they can edit their courses, add friends, join study sessions from the Google
            Map, or create their own study session.  Once enrolled in a study session, they can open a special page for each session
            they are a part of.  From there, they have access to a shared group chat, task board, and whiteboard that all members of
            the study session can interact with. 
            <br><br>
            This was a three person project.  I served as the team lead for this project.  The areas I worked on were the following: 
            Google Sign-in, study session creation, profile creation and editing, Google Maps API, custom navigation drawer, 
            and linking the front-end to the back-end.  The front-end was created using Java and Android Studio, taking advantage
            of the Google Maps API and Google Sign-in.  The backend was created using nodeJS and MongoDB.
            <br><br>
            This was the most significant project I've worked on so far, and thus I gained a lot.  I became a lot more confident
            in my ability as a programmer, as this was the first real project where we weren't given a skeleton code to fill in; we
            dictated how the project looked, what it did, etc.  Furthermore, this was my first real experience working on a team,
            and thus I learned a lot about working with a group on a larger-scale project.

                <span class="text-muted">Personal Android Application (IN PROGRESS)</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This application was designed to help automate some of the more repetitive aspects of Dungeons and Dragons, such as rolling a 
            significant amount of dice, creating a character, and generating treasure.  The user opens to a home screen and from there, can select which feature
            they would like to use.  From there, it is dependant on what feature they are using, but most have a few boxes for the user to fill in (for example,
            the number of dice to roll, how many sides they have, etc.), as well as a button to run the program.
            <br><br>
            This is a personal project, and the first Android project that I worked on.  It is something I like to come back to from time to time when I have some
            inspiration.  I have developed the entire applicaiton, using Java Android Studio.  None of the finished sections have need for a back-end, so as of now
            it is just a front end only application.
            <br><br>
            This project has been significant in my growth as a programmer as it was the first project that I worked on outside of my coursework.  I worked on it because
            it was something I genuinely wanted to design. Futhermore, I had never done Android development prior to this, so it gave me the opportunity to learn.  Because
            I had never done Android development, this gave me the confidence to teach myself aspects of programming as opposed to only learning in class.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This application was designed to compare the Google Cloud Vision and Clarifai APIs.  It was developed during HackISU 
            Fall 2016.  The application allows the user to take a photo of anything.  The image is then analyzed by both APIs, and the top 5 tags
            generated by each are displayed in an anonymous manner.  The user then votes on which set of tags best describes the image.  A running total
            of both which API is selected, and the time taken to analyze, is stored for reference.
            <br><br>
            This was developed as a three person Android Application.  For this project, I mainly focused on the using the camera, as well as doing data
            analysis on the collected information.  I also worked on displaying the information in a pie chart for a visual representation of the information.
            This app was developed using Java and Android Studio, as well as the Clarifai and Google Cloud Vision APIs.
            <br><br>
            Developing this application helped my discover my interest in data and data analysis.  Though it was a relatively simple project, I realized
            how interesting I found comparing the data for each API, deciding which one is better, etc.  It motivated me to take a class on Big Data and
            explore this interest even further.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This game was designed to take advantage of the Myo armband.  It was developed during HackISU Spring 2014.  The game
            allows the user, using the Myo armband, to lift objects, move them around, and either place them in a new location or suspend them
            in the air.  They do this in order to solve a series of puzzles and platforming challenges.
            <br><br>
            This was developed as a three person Unity project.  Most of my time was spent 3D modeling and designing levels, with a little bit of
            scripting for movement.  I also set up and tested the Myo armband. The scripting was done in C#, while the modeling was done using Blender
            and Unity.  The Myo was run using included software.
            <br><br>
            This project was the first time I worked under strict time constraints.  With coursework, we're usually given more than enough time to
            complete the assignments.  For this project, we only had 36 hours to complete the project, so I learned a lot about time management,
            feature prioritization, and generally working in crunch time.

            <p class="lead">This project is designed to use Computer Vision to identify differences between a physical object and a 3D model
            of the same type of object.  A user should be able to show an object to a camera.  A 3D model of the item will be generated and
            compared against a stock 3D model for the same object.  Then, any differences between the two will be noted and returned to the
            user.
            <br><br>
            This will be developed as a four person project.  I am serving as the team lead.  We anticipate using OpenCV and C++, along with
            an Intel RealSense camera.
