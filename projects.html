                <span class="text-muted">Group Android Application</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This application was designed to help the user find other students in courses they were enrolled in
            to study with.  The user is prompted to login with a Google Account, which all Iowa State students have.  They open
            to a Google Map, where they can see all study sessions occuring in the next 2 weeks for courses they are enrolled in
            when creating the account.  From there, they can edit their courses, add friends, join study sessions from the Google
            Map, or create their own study session.  Once enrolled in a study session, they can open a special page for each session
            they are a part of.  From there, they have access to a shared group chat, task board, and whiteboard that all members of
            the study session can interact with. 
            <br><br>
            This was a 3 person project.  I served as the team lead for this project.  The areas I worked on were the following: 
            Google Sign-in, study session creation, profile creation and editing, Google Maps API, custom navigation drawer, 
            and linking the front-end to the back-end.  The front-end was created using Java and Android Studio, taking advantage
            of the Google Maps API and Google Sign-in.  The backend was created using nodeJS and MongoDB.
            <br><br>
            This was the most significant project I've worked on so far, and thus I gained a lot.  I became a lot more confident
            in my ability as a programmer, as this was the first real project where we weren't given a skeleton code to fill in; we
            dictated how the project looked, what it did, etc.  Furthermore, this was my first real experience working on a team,
            and thus I learned a lot about working with a group on a larger-scale project.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Personal Android Application (IN PROGRESS)</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This application was designed to help automate some of the more repetitive aspects of Dungeons and Dragons, such as rolling a 
            significant amount of dice, creating a character, and generating treasure.  The user opens to a home screen and from there, can select which feature
            they would like to use.  From there, it is dependant on what feature they are using, but most have a few boxes for the user to fill in (for example,
            the number of dice to roll, how many sides they have, etc.), as well as a button to run the program.
            <br><br>
            This is a personal project, and the first Android project that I worked on.  It is something I like to come back to from time to time when I have some
            inspiration.  I have developed the entire applicaiton, using Java Android Studio.  None of the finished sections have need for a back-end, so as of now
            it is just a front end only application.
            <br><br>
            This project has been significant in my growth as a programmer as it was the first project that I worked on outside of my coursework.  I worked on it because
            it was something I genuinely wanted to design. Futhermore, I had never done Android development prior to this, so it gave me the opportunity to learn.  Because
            I had never done Android development, this gave me the confidence to teach myself aspects of programming as opposed to only learning in class.</p>
