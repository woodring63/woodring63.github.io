            </h2>
            <p class="lead">During the summer of 2016, I had an internship at Higher Learning Technologies in
			Coralville, Iowa.  While there, I primarily worked on the iOS team, but spent a little bit of time
			working with the Android and Web development teams.
			<br><br>One of the major things I worked on while there was adding answer hiding to their flashcards.
			If a user wished to hide an answer was incorrect, they were now presented with a button which toggles
			the answer off and grays out the selection.  Another major project of mine was optimizing the build process.
			I wrote a couple of scripts to better take advantage of "BuddyBuild", the software they used to build and deploy
			apps to the app store.  Furthermore, I was had to fix some failing tests to optimize this build process.
			<br><br>At the end of the internship, I gave a presentation to my managers about what I had accomplished
			over the course of the summer.
			<br><br>During this experience, I not only learned technical information such as Swift, Objective C, and BuddyBuild,
			but also how to work on an established code base and on a large team.  I was able to experience first hand what it 
			is like to work in agile environment at a startup.</p>
